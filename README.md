# ZombieApocalypseSim
Simulates a zombie apocalypse including social dynamics (e.g.: sentimentality, stigmatization). The code for this simulation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook. 

# Dependencies
The simulations were created using the following software packages and libraries.

* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [IPython 3.2.1](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/)
* A version of [nxsim](https://github.com/jrriebling/nxsim) with added logging capabilities for edges. The original version by kentwait can be found [here](https://github.com/kentwait/nxsim).
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.
* [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) to make it look nicer.
